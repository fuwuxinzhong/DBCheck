## AI-Assisted - Detect and Resolve Issues

### AI-Powered Intelligent Diagnosis

Leveraging a fully offline, local **Ollama** deployment, DBCheck analyzes inspection metrics (connection counts, cache hit ratios, slow queries, security risks, etc.) and automatically generates structured optimization recommendations. AI insights are rendered as a dedicated chapter in the report — Markdown content is automatically styled into Word format (bold, code blocks, lists, numbered headings), ready to share with your team or leadership.

| Backend | Characteristics | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| `ollama` | Local-only, zero cost, no network dependency | Air-gapped environments, high data-security requirements |
| `disabled` | AI disabled (default) | Offline environments / AI not required |

> **Security Notice**: AI diagnosis is strictly limited to local Ollama (localhost:11434). Inspection data is never sent to any third-party service. This is enforced at the code level — even if the configuration file is tampered with to use a remote address, the system will automatically fall back to the disabled state.

### Risk Detection and Recommendations

Each risk is presented as a card: **Risk Level (High/Medium/Low) → Issue Description → Remediation SQL (copy-paste ready) → Priority & Owner**. The report automatically aggregates all findings so you can see every pending item at a glance.

### System Resource Monitoring

- **CPU**: utilization, core count, clock speed
- **Memory**: total, used, available, utilization rate
- **Disk**: capacity and utilization per mount point
- **Collection**: local collection or SSH remote collection (password/key auth supported, default port 22); Dameng DM8 supports SSH collection with automatic fallback to local collector on failure

### Intelligent Risk Analysis

Automatically detects potential database risks — **each risk includes an executable remediation SQL** ready to copy and run:

#### MySQL (18+ rules)

| Dimension | Example Rules |
|-----------|--------------|
| Connections | Usage >90% = critical / >80% = warning |
| Memory | InnoDB buffer pool too small (< 60% of data size) |
| Disk | Usage >85% = warning / >95% = critical |
| Queries | Long-running SQL (>60s), slow query log disabled |
| Locks | High lock wait ratio |
| Security | Empty password users, root@% exposure, non-UTF8 charset |
| Replication | Master-slave lag >30s, replication errors |
| Other | binlog disabled, query cache remnants, excessive aborted connections |

#### PostgreSQL (16+ rules)

| Dimension | Example Rules |
|-----------|--------------|
| Connections | Near limit, too many superusers |
| Cache | Low hit ratio (<80%), undersized shared_buffers |
| Performance | Large accumulation of dead tuples, long-running SQL |
| Security | Overly permissive public schema permissions |
| Archiving | Archiving mode disabled |
| Other | Disk / memory / CPU resource alerts |

#### Oracle (20+ rules)

| Dimension | Example Rules |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tablespace | Usage >90% (including autoextend calculation) |
| TEMP | Temp tablespace usage too high |
| Sessions | Near limit / process overflow / lock blocking |
| Memory | SGA too large relative to physical memory |
| Redo | Redo log group issues / frequent switches |
| Backup | Archiving disabled / missing RMAN backups |
| DG | MRP not running / protection mode too low |
| ASM | Disk group space insufficient / offline disks |
| FRA | Flashback Recovery Area usage too high |
| Objects | Too many invalid objects / stale statistics |
| Security | Permissive Profile password policy / auditing disabled |
| Other | open_cursors too small / recycle bin bloat / datafiles offline |

#### DM8 (16+ rules)

| Dimension | Example Rules |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tablespace | Usage >90% (including autoextend calculation) |
| Memory | Pool misconfigurations (KEEP/RECYCLE/FAST/NORMAL/ROLL) |
| Sessions | Near connection limit / long-running sessions |
| Transactions | Blocking transaction detection / waits |
| Backup | Missing backup sets / backup timeouts |
| Parameters | Key parameters (INSTANCE_MODE, COMPATIBLE_VERSION, etc.) |
| Security | Empty passwords / overly broad permissions / auditing disabled |
| Objects | Invalid objects / stale statistics / partitioned table info |
| Archiving | Archiving disabled / log accumulation |

### Historical Trend Analysis

> Run multiple inspections on the same database, and DBCheck automatically aggregates the data to generate trend charts — spotting gradual changes before they become incidents.

- After each inspection, key metrics (memory utilization, connections, QPS, CPU, etc.) are written to local `history.json`
- Data is aggregated per database (IP + port + type), retaining up to 30 historical records
- The Web UI provides a **trend analysis page** with line charts and threshold lines
- Side-by-side comparison with the previous run: changes shown with colored arrows (↑ deteriorating / ↓ improving)

### AI-Powered Diagnosis

> Leveraging inspection data, DBCheck calls a local Ollama LLM to generate personalized optimization recommendations — evolving from "problem detection" to "problem resolution".

Comparison of Intelligent Analysis vs. AI Diagnosis:

| | Intelligent Analysis | AI Diagnosis |
|---|---|---|
| Principle | Fixed rules, deterministic offline judgment | Local LLM inference, personalized output |
| Speed | Milliseconds | Depends on model response time |
| Output | Deterministic conclusions + remediation SQL | Natural language recommendations, Markdown auto-rendered to Word |
| Invocation | Runs automatically on every inspection | On-demand (can be disabled) |

**AI Backend Configuration (Web UI Settings):**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Backend Type | `ollama` or `disabled` |
| API Address | Default `http://localhost:11434` (localhost only) |
| Model Name | e.g. `qwen3:30b`, `qwen3:8b`, `llama3`, etc. |
| Timeout | Default 600 seconds (LLM cold start can be slow) |

> For security reasons, any non-localhost API address is automatically rejected by the code to prevent data leakage.

### OpenClaw Skill

DBCheck is published as an OpenClaw Skill on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/skills/dbcheck). Once installed in your AI assistant, you can trigger inspections via natural language — no CLI or Web UI needed.

#### Installation

Run in your OpenClaw client:

```bash
clawhub install dbcheck
```

#### Usage

After installation, simply tell your AI assistant what you need, for example:

> "Inspect the Oracle production库 at IP 192.168.1.10, username sys as sysdba"

The AI assistant will load the Skill, ask for missing information step by step (port, service name, inspector name, etc.), then invoke the inspection script to generate a Word report.

#### Supported Commands

## FAQ

### General

1. **Some content is empty or missing**
   When template rendering encounters compatibility issues, the program automatically switches to a fallback rendering mode and still produces a complete report with all key data — usage is unaffected.

2. **Connection failure**
   Verify that the database allows remote access, the user has sufficient privileges, and the firewall permits the relevant port.

3. **SSH collection failure**
   Confirm the SSH service is running (default port 22) and authentication credentials are correct. Some stripped-down Linux distributions lack commands like `lscpu`, causing CPU information to show "not obtained" — this is normal.

4. **AI diagnosis not working**
   - Confirm a valid configuration is saved in Web UI → AI Diagnosis Settings
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Ensure the model is downloaded: `ollama pull qwen3:30b` (larger models recommended; cold start is slow)

5. **Risk recommendations are for reference only**
   Built-in thresholds are based on general best practices. Evaluate them in the context of your actual workload.

### Oracle-Specific

6. **ORA-01017 invalid username/password**
   - For SYSDBA access: check the "SYSDBA" box in Web UI; in CLI, enter `sys as sysdba` (full format) — the tool automatically parses and uses the correct privileged mode
   - Verify the password is correct (case-sensitive)

7. **ORA-00904 / ORA-00942 invalid identifier**
   Some advanced views/columns may not exist in certain Oracle versions (e.g., 11g vs 19c). The tool handles compatibility gracefully; incompatible items are marked with ⚠️ and skipped without affecting the overall inspection.

8. **Do I need to install an Oracle client?**
   - Using `oracledb` driver (recommended): No — pure Python implementation
   - Using `cx_Oracle` driver: Yes — download [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client.html)

9. **Oracle version support**
   Supports **11g R2, 12c, 19c, 21c** and above. SQL templates are cross-version compatible.

### DM8-Specific

10. **Connection failure (returned a result with an exception set)**
    - dmPython uses lazy connections — a successful connection object creation does not mean the connection is actually established; a probe SQL must be executed via cursor to confirm
    - The tool includes built-in auto-probe logic. If it still fails, check: correct port (default 5236), correct user password, and whether the server allows access from your IP

11. **"Invalid column name" error**
    - DM8's V$ view column names differ significantly from Oracle; the tool has been adapted for DM8实测 column names. If errors persist, please send a screenshot so we can add support.

12. **SSH collection not available**
    - Limited by the Dameng server's OpenSSH version (port 2022), SSH collection is temporarily disabled. System resource information will use the local collector. Local and Dameng server information being inconsistent is expected.

13. **"Server hostname/platform" in the report shows local machine info**
    - A known limitation when SSH collection is disabled; Dameng server system info collection depends on the SSH channel and will be addressed in a future version.
